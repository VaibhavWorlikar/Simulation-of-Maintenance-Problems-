## Simulation of Maintenance Problems

# Overview
This project simulates machine maintenance scenarios to optimize maintenance strategies based on user-defined parameters. Built using Python, SQLite, and Tkinter, the simulation evaluates various maintenance approaches, including preventive, reactive, and replacement policies, providing actionable insights for effective machinery management.

# Features
•	User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for easy parameter input and result visualization.
•	Parameter Simulation: Users can define key parameters such as machine type, usage frequency, and failure rates to model different maintenance situations.
•	Maintenance Strategy Evaluation: Algorithms assess optimal maintenance strategies tailored to the input parameters, recommending the best approach for each scenario.
•	Data Management: Utilizes SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of machine data and maintenance history, allowing for comprehensive analysis.
•	Result Analysis: Provides insights into maintenance outcomes, helping users make informed decisions regarding machinery upkeep and replacement policies.

# Technologies Used
•	Python: Core programming language for simulation logic and GUI development.
•	SQLite: Lightweight database for storing and managing machine data.
•	Tkinter: Library for creating the graphical user interface.
