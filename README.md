# Simulation-of-Maintenance-Problems-
This project simulates machine maintenance scenarios to optimize maintenance strategies based on user-defined parameters. Built using Python, SQLite, and Tkinter, the simulation evaluates various maintenance approaches, including preventive, reactive, and replacement policies, providing actionable insights for effective machinery management.
